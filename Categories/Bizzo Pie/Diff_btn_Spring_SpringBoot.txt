Spring and Spring Boot are two popular Java frameworks for building enterprise applications. They have some similarities and differences, which I will explain below.
Spring is an open-source framework that uses various techniques such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming to develop web applications. Spring provides a rich set of features and modules, such as Spring MVC, Spring ORM, Spring AOP, etc. Spring allows developers to customize their applications according to their needs and preferences. However, Spring also requires a lot of configuration and boilerplate code, which can make the development process complex and time-consuming.
Spring Boot is a module of Spring that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications. Spring Boot provides auto-configuration and embedded servers, which means that it automatically configures the classes based on the dependencies and requirements of the application. It also offers starter projects, which are pre-configured with the necessary dependencies for a specific functionality. Spring Boot aims to reduce the amount of code and configuration needed to create a stand-alone application with minimal or zero overhead.
Some of the main differences between Spring and Spring Boot are:
- Spring is a framework that can be used for any type of Java application, while Spring Boot is mainly used for developing RESTful APIs.
- Spring requires manual configuration and dependency management, while Spring Boot provides auto-configuration and dependency management.
- Spring supports multiple types of servers, such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc., while Spring Boot provides an embedded server that can run the application without any external server.
- Spring has more features and modules than Spring Boot, but also more complexity and overhead.
